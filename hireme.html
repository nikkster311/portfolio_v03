              Are you looking for a personable developer who values consistant
              and clear communication and will make your project their highest
              priority? If so, I'm your dev. ðŸ˜‰
            </h3>
            <p>
              As someone with a past career as a park ranger and classroom
              educator, I have extensive experience with organizing and leading
              teams, public speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when
              last minute changes arise. Clear and consistent communication is
              incredibly important to me, and I will make sure that we are on
              the same page throughout the project, and that you are up to date
              with my work as the project goes on. If things end up being more
              complicated than expected, or I feel that there are better ways to
              implement parts of your site for the best user experience, I will
              be sure to discuss it with you before moving forward.
