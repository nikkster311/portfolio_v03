              I can build and edit sites from scratch or made with website
              builders. I excel at working on
              <span class="light">Shopify</span> and
              <span class="light">WordPress</span> sites, but I also have
              experience with Wix, Weebly, WebFlow, and SquareSpace and am happy
              to work on those sites as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              After years of practice, <span class="light">CSS</span> is one of
              my favorite things to tackle. Send me your CSS frustrations!

            <p>
              We will work together to make your website stand out so that you
              can gain more customers and get rid of any tech roadblocks.

              Are you looking for a personable developer who values consistant
              and clear communication and will make your project their highest
              priority? If so, I'm your dev. ðŸ˜‰
            </h3>
            <p>
              As someone with a past career as a park ranger and classroom
              educator, I have extensive experience with organizing and leading
              teams, public speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when
              last minute changes arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="light"
                >Clear and consistent communication is incredibly important to
                me,</span
              >
              and I will make sure that we are on the same page throughout the
              project and that you are up to date with my work as the project
              goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
              If things end up being more complicated than expected, or I feel
              that there are better ways to implement parts of your site for the
              best user experience, I will be sure to discuss it with you before
              moving forward.

                Previously I worked as a park ranger which allowed me to spend
                quality time outdoors and experience life in different parts of
                the United States.

              <p class="tagline">
                The outdoors inspires my work and drives me to build beautiful,

              <p>
                My experience as a park ranger and classroom educator gave me
                extensive experience with organizing and leading teams, public
                speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when last minute
                changes arose.
