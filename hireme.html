            <p>
              I am a web developer with experience building and deploying
              responsive websites and user-friendly applications. I specialize
              in Angular, React and Node.js, as well as HTML, CSS, and
              Javascript. I also have experience with data analysis and
              interpretation of data. Some projects I have done include
              development on multiple Shopify sites, creating dynamic webpages
              using PHP and WordPress, and working with a University on an
              internal Angular web application. WHAT I CAN OFFER YOU: Services I
              offer include creating Front-End applications, Full Stack
              applications, and websites from scratch, picking up from where
              someone left off, and optimizing your code. I am also available
              for debugging or enhancing your project to make it the best it can
              be. My previous work as an educator will prove useful if you are
              looking for someone to help you learn or better comprehend React,
              Front-End, or Full Stack development.
