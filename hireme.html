              <span class="light">Shopify</span> and

              After years of practice, <span class="light">CSS</span> is one of

            <h3 class="tagline">
              Are you looking for a personable developer who values consistant
              and clear communication and will make your project their highest
              priority? If so, I'm your dev. ðŸ˜‰
            </h3>
            <p>
              As someone with a past career as a park ranger and classroom
              educator, I have extensive experience with organizing and leading
              teams, public speaking, and being flexible/problem solving when
              last minute changes arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="light"

                me,</span
              >
              and I will make sure that we are on the same page throughout the
              project and that you are up to date with my work as the project
              goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
              If things end up being more complicated than expected, or I feel
              that there are better ways to implement parts of your site for the
              best user experience, I will be sure to discuss it with you before
              moving forward.
