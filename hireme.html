                  for small businesses and independent contractors who want to
                  take their business to the next level. We will work together
                  to make your website stand out so that you can gain more
                  customers and get rid of any tech roadblocks. I am passionate
                  about building things that automate the mundane and building
                  beautiful, thoughtful websites that work flawlessly on all
                  devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Previously I worked as a park ranger which allowed me to spend
                  quality time outdoors and experience life in different parts
                  of the United States. The outdoors inspires my work and drives
                  me to build beautiful, thoughtful creations.

                <p>
                  My experience as a park ranger and classroom educator gave me

                  changes arose.

                <p>
                  Since 2020 I have worked on web apps and websites using
                  frameworks including React and Angular, as well as HTML, CSS,
                  Javascript. I have also worked on numerous Shopify sites,
                  ensuring that my clients' customers have flawless shopping
                  experiences on all devices.
